From the original author, franksmicro:
I was looking for a library to handle CAN on the Arduino using the MCP2515 
chip (such as is found in the Sparkfun CAN shield).  The only library I could
find was not in English, so I decided to write a library myself.

I have tested this library using the example OBDMPG program.  This program
successfully displays gas mileage statistics for my OBD2-compatible car on
the serial LCD.  It should be easy enough to change the sample program to
display other OBD parameters.  If your car uses a different baud rate than
500k, you will need to change this as well.

I can't promise support for this library, but feel free to E-mail me if
you have a question or see a problem.  If you make improvements, feel free
to contact me and I will consider merging your changes into the library,
with appropriate credit.

Frank
